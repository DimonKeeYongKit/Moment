# Time Visualization App
A mobile app built with React Native and Expo that visualizes time in different granularities (seconds, hours, weeks, days) through interactive grids. Each grid represents a unit of time (e.g., 60 seconds, 24 hours, 53 weeks, 365/366 days) and dynamically highlights the current time unit based on the system clock.
